## Unsolved Problems and Major Hurdles
- I was spending most of time on shuffling the card so I have to do a lot of research and learn from there.
- My mute button is only work on the background music. Which I also want to leave the sound effect for the alert. But technically I couldn't make it all to mute at the same time so I have to do it that way.
